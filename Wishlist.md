## Display all contact fields in the duplicate window for adding data ##
Some users request this, since they want to manually add data to the remaining contact. On the other hand, it is important to have a quick overview over the field that contain the important (= the differing) values. So this might be an option/button "Show all fields" / "Show only fields with values" or "Show empty fields (On/Off)".

## Ability to save both individual contacts in the duplicate window without merging them ##
During the address book walkthrough, the user might recognize that both presented contacts of a pair have to be saved, but the user would like to complete/modify the data of one or both.

## Ability to delete both presented contacts ##
If none of the presented contacts is required any longer, e.g. because the more complete variant has been presented before, the user wants to eliminate both.

## Store the information that a certain pair is not a duplicate in order to avoid presentation in future runs ##
If "John A" and "John B" turn out not to be the same person, the add-on might be so clever to memorize that information and save the user clicks in future runs.

## Trash can for deleted/modified contacts ##
As a backup, the add-on should copy each contact to be modified into a save place and also move contacts to be deleted over there instead of actual deletion. This "safe place" could be a new address book. If "find duplicates across address books" should ever be accomplished, this address book of course would have to be ignored.

## Display a list of all duplicates instead of processing pair by pair ##
The aim of this change would be to prevent all duplicates at a time in a list, where users can mass edit details and resolve duplicates, in order to save the time now used for waiting while the add-on is processing. (Half-done. Find duplicate first and ask later).
