The Duplicate Contact Manager is a Thunderbird extention/Addon that allows the user to get rid of contact dupicates, one at a time.

The addon presents two contacts as a duplicate pair and lets the user decide what to do with the two. The user can also manually merge date between the two presented contacts.

## How it works ##
The Duplicate Contact Manager compares all contacts from your currently selected address book and searches for pairs with common information. These pairs are presented to you in order to decide if the two contacts are a duplicate or not.
